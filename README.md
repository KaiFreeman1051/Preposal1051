# Preposal1051 

What ideas do you have for a final project? 
app that allows users to find bachground of certain topics 

If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Do you have any questions of your own? 
Is the project limited to code we learned?




# Proposal1051 


## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

R6 gaming Operators

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My goal with this project is to create a app that has pages were you can see the background of characters

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software is very simple. I will load up the app. Upon entry the user will be created with a header of welcome. They will then see a list of Rainbow Six Siege operators anc can click on their page for background on each operator

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

a good outcome for me would be having clickable pages with headers

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a better outcome would be to have some operators and their bios in the app

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

best outcome would be clickable pages with all bios in the app.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to figure out how to code clickable pages. I will need to figure out how to add headers. From this point i can hopefully just have a Print statement to convey the details of each operator. I am still figuring out my organization. I don't know if i want to split the operator by country origin or utility or just attacker and defender operators.
